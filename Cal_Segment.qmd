## Goals

-   Prompt user for additional info re: segmenting

-   write separate function/script

-   require two+ vector inputs defining seg1 start, seg1 stop, seg2 start, seg2 stop, etc. How to encode flexibility here..?

-   recalculate cumulative values from 0 for each, recalculate elapsed time from 0 for each
