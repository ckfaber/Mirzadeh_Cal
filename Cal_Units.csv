Sable_Var,Renamed_Var,Title,Unit,Description
AllMeters_M,NA,NA,(m),"Cumulative sum of all distances traveled within the beam break system (excluding running wheel if present). This includes fine movement (such as grooming and scratching), as well as directed locomotion. _M denotes mean during 30s sampling"
AllMeters_R,AllMeters,Activity,(m),"Sum of all distances traveled within the beam break system (excluding running wheel if present). This includes fine movement (such as grooming and scratching), as well as directed locomotion. _R denotes range from last cage sample to current cage sample - in other words, the total distance the mouse traveled since the cage was last selected."
Animal,Cage,NA,NA,Cage number
BodyMass_M,BodyMass,Body Mass,(g),Mean body mass of animal
FoodInA_M,FoodIn.cum,Cumulative Food Intake,(g),Mass of food consumed by animal during the cycle
kcal_hr_M,EE,Energy Expenditure,(kcal/hr),Mean energy expenditure in kcal/hr. Calculated using the Weir equation
PedMeters_M,NA,NA,(m),"Sum of all directed ambulatory locomotion within the beam break system (excludes wheel if present). For defining directed locomotion, the macros use a cutoff speed of 1 cm/s - if the animals travel at that speed or faster, it is considered to be directed locomotion."
PedMeters_R,PedMeters,Directed Activity,(m),"Sum of all directed ambulatory locomotion within the beam break system (excludes wheel if present). For defining directed locomotion, the macros use a cutoff speed of 1 cm/s - if the animals travel at that speed or faster, it is considered to be directed locomotion."
PedSpeed_Mnz,PedSpeed,Directed Speed,(m/s),Mean directed ambulatory locomotion speed. _Mnz indicates zero values were excluded in calculating the mean
