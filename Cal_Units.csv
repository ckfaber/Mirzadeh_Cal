Sable_Var,Renamed_Var,Title,Unit,Description
AllMeters_M,NA,NA,(m),"Cumulative sum of all distances traveled within the beam break system (excluding running wheel if present). This includes fine movement (such as grooming and scratching), as well as directed locomotion. _M denotes mean during 30s sampling"
AllMeters_R,AllMeters,Activity,(m),"Sum of all distances traveled within the beam break system (excluding running wheel if present). This includes fine movement (such as grooming and scratching), as well as directed locomotion. _R denotes range from last cage sample to current cage sample - in other words, the total distance the mouse traveled since the cage was last selected."
Animal,Cage,NA,NA,Cage number
BodyMass_M,BodyMass,Body Mass,(g),Mean body mass of animal
FoodInA_M,FoodIn.cum,Cumulative Food Intake,(g),Mass of food consumed by animal during the cycle
kcal_hr_M,EE,Energy Expenditure,(kcal/hr),Mean energy expenditure in kcal/hr. Calculated using the Weir equation
PedMeters_M,NA,NA,(m),"Sum of all directed ambulatory locomotion within the beam break system (excludes wheel if present). For defining directed locomotion, the macros use a cutoff speed of 1 cm/s - if the animals travel at that speed or faster, it is considered to be directed locomotion."
PedMeters_R,PedMeters,Directed Activity,(m),"Sum of all directed ambulatory locomotion within the beam break system (excludes wheel if present). For defining directed locomotion, the macros use a cutoff speed of 1 cm/s - if the animals travel at that speed or faster, it is considered to be directed locomotion."

NA,EE.kcal.bin,NA,(kcal),"Temporary variable. Calculated from EE. Since each value in EE is an instantaneous measurement of kcal/hr, to get the approximate kcal burned across the sampling interval, EE was multiplied by the interval in hours (e.g., 0.05h for a 3-minute interval)"
