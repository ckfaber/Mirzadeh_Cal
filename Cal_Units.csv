Sable_Var,Renamed_Var,Unit,Description
AllMeters_M,NA,m,"Cumulative sum of all distances traveled within the beam break system (excluding running wheel if present). This includes fine movement (such as grooming and scratching), as well as directed locomotion. _M denotes mean during 30s sampling"
AllMeters_R,AllMeters,m,"Sum of all distances traveled within the beam break system (excluding running wheel if present). This includes fine movement (such as grooming and scratching), as well as directed locomotion. _R denotes range from last cage sample to current cage sample - in other words, the total distance the mouse traveled since the cage was last selected."
Animal,Cage,NA,Cage number
BodyMass_M,BodyMass,g,Mean body mass of animal
FoodInA_M,FoodIn.cum,g,Mass of food consumed by animal during the cycle
kcal_hr_M,EE,kcal/hr,Mean energy expenditure in kcal/hr. Calculated using the Weir equation
PedMeters_M,NA,m,"Sum of all directed ambulatory locomotion within the beam break system (excludes wheel if present). For defining directed locomotion, the macros use a cutoff speed of 1 cm/s - if the animals travel at that speed or faster, it is considered to be directed locomotion."
PedMeters_R,PedMeters,m,"Sum of all directed ambulatory locomotion within the beam break system (excludes wheel if present). For defining directed locomotion, the macros use a cutoff speed of 1 cm/s - if the animals travel at that speed or faster, it is considered to be directed locomotion."
PedSpeed_Mnz,PedSpeed,m/s,Mean directed ambulatory locomotion speed. _Mnz indicates zero values were excluded in calculating the mean
RER_M,RER,NA,"Mean respiratory exchange ratio, VCO2/VO2, unitless"
VCO2_M,VCO2,ml/min,Rate of carbon dioxide emission
VH2O_M,VH2O,g/hr,Rate of water vapor loss
VO2_M,VO2,ml/min,Rate of oxygen consumption
WaterInA_M,WaterIn.cum,g,Mass of water consumed by animal during the cycle
Xbreak_R,XBreak,count,Number of x-axis beam breaks
Ybreak_R,YBreak,count,Number of y-axis beam breaks
