Sable_Var,Renamed_Var,Title,Unit,Description
AllMeters_M,NA,NA,(m),"Cumulative sum of all distances traveled within the beam break system (excluding running wheel if present). This includes fine movement (such as grooming and scratching), as well as directed locomotion. _M denotes mean during 30s sampling"
AllMeters_R,AllMeters,Activity,(m),"Sum of all distances traveled within the beam break system (excluding running wheel if present). This includes fine movement (such as grooming and scratching), as well as directed locomotion. _R denotes range from last cage sample to current cage sample - in other words, the total distance the mouse traveled since the cage was last selected."
Animal,Cage,NA,NA,Cage number
BodyMass_M,BodyMass,Body Mass,(g),Mean body mass of animal
FoodInA_M,FoodIn.cum,Cumulative Food Intake,(g),Mass of food consumed by animal during the cycle
kcal_hr_M,EE,Energy Expenditure,(kcal/hr),Mean energy expenditure in kcal/hr. Calculated using the Weir equation
PedMeters_M,NA,NA,(m),"Sum of all directed ambulatory locomotion within the beam break system (excludes wheel if present). For defining directed locomotion, the macros use a cutoff speed of 1 cm/s - if the animals travel at that speed or faster, it is considered to be directed locomotion."
PedMeters_R,PedMeters,Directed Activity,(m),"Sum of all directed ambulatory locomotion within the beam break system (excludes wheel if present). For defining directed locomotion, the macros use a cutoff speed of 1 cm/s - if the animals travel at that speed or faster, it is considered to be directed locomotion."
PedSpeed_Mnz,PedSpeed,Directed Speed,(m/s),Mean directed ambulatory locomotion speed. _Mnz indicates zero values were excluded in calculating the mean
RER_M,RER,RER,NA,"Mean respiratory exchange ratio, VCO2/VO2, unitless"
VCO2_M,VCO2,vCO2 Emission,(mL/min),Rate of carbon dioxide emission
VH2O_M,VH2O,vH2O Loss,(g/hr),Rate of water vapor loss
VO2_M,VO2,vO2 Consumption,(mL/min),Rate of oxygen consumption
WaterInA_M,WaterIn.cum,Cumulative Water Intake,(g),Mass of water consumed by animal during the cycle
Xbreak_R,XBreak,Beam Breaks (x),(count),Number of x-axis beam breaks
Ybreak_R,YBreak,Beam Breaks (y),(count),Number of y-axis beam breaks

,EE.kcal.bin,NA,(kcal),"Temporary variable. Calculated from EE. Since each value in EE is an instantaneous measurement of kcal/hr, to get the approximate kcal burned across the sampling interval, EE was multiplied by the interval in hours (e.g., 0.05h for a 3-minute interval)"
,AllMeters.cum,Cumulative Activity,(m),Calculated from AllMeters using cumsum()
,FoodIn.g,Food Intake,(g),Calculated from FoodIn.cum using diff()
,WaterIn.g,Water Intake,(g),Calculated from WaterIn.cum using diff()
,FoodIn.kcal,Food Intake,(kcal),Calculated from FoodIn.g*4.2
,EBalance,Energy Balance,(kcal),Calculated as calories in minus calories out: FoodIn.kcal - EE.kcal.bin
